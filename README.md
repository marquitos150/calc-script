## How To Use
This section presents everything you need to know about how to use the Dark Calculator. While it is already intuitive to use an online calculator without looking over the instructions, there are important considerations and constraints to keep in mind. 

> [!NOTE]
> The calculator offers support for both on-screen control and keyboard input, which function in much the same way. Because of this, the following discussion will refer to the UI buttons only, except in cases where keyboard input is not supported. All the supported keys are listed in the [Supported Keys for Keyboard Control](#supported-keys-for-keyboard-control) section.
